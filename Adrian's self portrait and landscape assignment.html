        <p><b>Description:</b>Learned how to make a self portrait and landscape through coding</p>
        
        <p><b>Technical notes:</b>p5j program</p>
        
        <p><b>Process documentation:</b>I did bits and pieces through 
            following the self portrait videos and then understood what to do for the landscape by then.</p>
        
        <p><b>Reflection:</b>I didn't really know something like this was a thing until then or if this was to be expected to be done as an assignment before given to us.
    I'd say I had alot of fun though! It was very creative and had fun just messing around fnding random things to add and do to the assignment.
            Definitely simple for many to do and isn't much stress if at all. Learned how to make in another simple but
        creative way if i ever want to make something different than normal.</p>
