    <p><b>Description:</b>Made two separate tokens with given prompts and using our own thought process to make exlcusive pieces thought by our own self.</p>
        
        <p><b>Technical notes:</b>Adobe Photoshop</p>
        
        <p><b>Process documentation:</b>found relatively similar ideas so I would not have to spend so much thought on two entirely separate tokens to do</p>
        
        <p><b>Reflection:</b>I thought it was gonna be annoying originally but while following it was not so bad and 
            i ended up finding my own way to make it simpler by just covering work so that it wasn't entirely obvious but wouldn't be regarded as cheating either.
        I learned how to make simple tokens which can be used for logos if possible or any type of brand related ideas.</p>
