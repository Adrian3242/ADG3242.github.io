       <p><b>Description: This assignment was to understand how to mask images over and through it.</b></p>
        
        <p><b>Technical notes:</b>Krita program</p>
        
        <p><b>Process documentation:</b>Still was on krita but I had no real issues this time it was more or less the same process but I had a good time.</p>
        
        <p><b>Reflection:</b>Had a pretty good time I would say this was a turning point of not having any real issues and just took a minute. I believe still looking at it I was pretty satsified and what I was trying to make made sense so overall positive about what came out of it.
        I learned how to make an edit like this where it is seen in things like magazine or website edits to emphasize certain buzzwords or the topic of is being shown.</p>
