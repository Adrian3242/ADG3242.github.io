       <p><b>Description:</b>The assignment was for understanding what was the process of how not to handle a photoshop.</p>
        
        <p><b>Technical notes:</b> Krita program</p>
        
        <p><b>Process documentation:</b> Still did not have krita so the process continuously was different but nothing too bad</p>
        
        <p><b>Reflection:</b>I think I had a decent understanding of what was going the challenge was the different program and not being able to distinctly make the edits not so obvious.
        Can't say I learned too much as my successfulness on it was not as good so there was a drop there.</p>
