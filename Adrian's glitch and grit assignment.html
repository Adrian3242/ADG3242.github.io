        <p><b>Description:</b>Learned how to make a website and shift it into github</p>
        
        <p><b>Technical notes:</b>Phoenix code</p>
        
        <p><b>Process documentation:</b>Process was done through phoenix code to do the coding</p>
        
        <p><b>Reflection:</b>I do alot of overthinking typically so an assignment like this,
            while it was not very hard there were parts where i either forgot entirely or did way too much for at certain aspects.
            I had fun learning how the process functioned and while it was not at a grand scale, 
            the website making was fun and satisfying.</p>
