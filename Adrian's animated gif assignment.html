       <p><b>Description:</b>Made gifs through a real life picture and one on the internet</p>
        
        <p><b>Technical notes:</b>adobe product:adobe photoshop</p>
        
        <p><b>Process documentation:</b>Worked on it through adobe photoshop did step by steps</p>
        
        <p><b>Reflection:</b>I believe I did just fine, the image went well and nothing was complicated on that end the image i took in person and
            trying to make it a gif was more challenging on my end so it could have gotten better but it's not that bad. 
            I learned how to deal with adobe since this was my first actual time on the program so the software was not that bad.</p>
