  <main>Hello! My name is Adrian Davila and I am an artist who prioritizes in drawing characters which I have done for a very long time and is just something I am pretty used to by now.
    My approach to digital media is originally just from signing up for the class not knowing what to expect but soon after understanding what and 
    how to figure things out for the assignments given to me in the class with new information such as understanding how to work with adobe products like illustrator and photoshop.
    I learned how to animate gifs, create art through code, make small form website and more.
    I believe it took me much more time than others to understand what went on during the assignments but I would say by now
    I have come to understand just how to deal with what has been given to me and have become a lot less stressful.
    
    <section id="Pixelated">
      <h2>Pixelated</h2>
      <p>We showed our skill on how to condense an image of our choosing to be formed into pixels.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Bad Photoshop</h2>
      <p>We had purposely done photoshop incorrectly by following specific guidelines for what does not work.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="project3">
      <h2>Perfect Mask</h2>
      <p>We dealt with perfectly covering an image and also having a separate image be surrounded in a specific color theme.</p>
    </section>
     
    <section id="project4">
      <h2>Animated gif</h2>
      <p>We learned how to make a gif and a basic animating picture from side to side from a picture we chose.</p>
    </section>
    
     <section id="project5">
      <h2>Glitch and Grit</h2>
      <p>Our very first website for the class to learn the mechanics of phoenix code and how to shift it into another area like github.com</p>
    </section>
    
     <section id="project6">
      <h2>Self portrait and Landscape</h2>
      <p>Went through pj5 to understand how to make art through coding by doing a simple self portrait and a landscape consisting of shapes built ontop of eachother.</p>
    </section>
    
     <section id="project7">
      <h2>Tokens</h2>
      <p>Made symbolic themed tokens which were dealt with creativity and a situation given to us that we had thought of in our own imagination.</p>
