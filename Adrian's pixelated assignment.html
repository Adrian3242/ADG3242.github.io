        <p><b>Description:</b> our first main assignment was on pixelated images where we would find random images and highly pixelate them. </p>
        
        <p><b>Technical notes:</b> krita program </p>
        
        <p><b>Process documentation:</b> As i did not have adobe products at the time the process of finding how to be able to do it was a hassle but I believe if i redid it through adobe I'd be just fine. </p>
        
        <p><b>Reflection:</b> I had a rough time just because the program i was on was not verry centered towards editing and 
            more focused on primarily art so i had to improvise but if i did it again through adobe it would be completely fine. I learned how to condense images so that certain parts are emphasized and focal points are more adjusted.</p>
